# Overview

This workflow guides you through setting up and running consensus clustering analysis. You can run the analysis in two ways:

- **Local**: Run directly on your local laptop/PC
- **HPC cluster**: Submit as a batch job to a high-performance computing cluster

---

# Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you are in the `consensusClustR` folder with `required_files` folder containing:

- `template.slurm.sh`
- `template.R`
- `performConsensusClustering.R`

The `performConsensusClustering.R` file should contain the following functions:

- `getTime()`
- `getConsensusClusters()`
- `performConsensusClustering()`

---

# Project setup

Provide a descriptive name for your project <Lastname_ProjectInfo>:  

```{r project-setup, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

project_name <- "Lastname_ProjectId"  # Change this to your project name
dir.create(project_name)

# copy required template files to project folder
file.copy("required_files/template.slurm.sh", to = project_name)
file.copy("required_files/template.R", to = project_name)
file.copy("required_files/performConsensusClustering.R", to = project_name)

```

Go to the project folder and customize template files.  

```{r configure-files, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Set working directory to project folder
setwd(project_name)

# Update SLURM script with project name
shFile <- readLines("template.slurm.sh", warn = FALSE)
shFile2 <- gsub(pattern = "project_name", replace = project_name, x = shFile)
writeLines(shFile2, con = paste0(project_name, ".slurm.sh"))

# Rename template R script
file.rename(from = "template.R", to = paste0(project_name, ".R"))

# Clean up 
file.remove("template.slurm.sh")
rm(shFile, shFile2)

```

**Note:** After running this chunk, you should see the following files in your project folder:

- `<project_name>.R` - Main analysis script.  
- `<project_name>.slurm.sh` - HPC submission script.  
- `performConsensusClustering.R` - Required functions.  

---

# Analysis setup

Open the `<project_name>.R` file from your project folder and provide values for the consensus clustering arguments.

Choose one of the following methods based on your computing environment:

## Run locally

Use this option for smaller datasets or when you want to run interactively. In the `<project_name>.R` file, execute the `source()` and `performConsensusClustering()` functions in your R session.   

Best part of local execution is that you  
- can debug interactively when there's an error
- make changes you want in the code and see the outcome immediately!
- don't have a queue as in the cluster environment  

---

## Run on HPC cluster

Use this option for large datasets or computationally intensive analyses. Ensure your HPC cluster uses SLURM workload manager.

- From your **local terminal** copy the project folder to a desired cluster location (consensus cluster folder, if you have one). You can use the `scp` command for transfer or the approach you use (like FileZilla).  
- Login to cluster and go to the project folder.  

TBA - an environment for consensus clustering.   

- Submit the SLURM job.

```{bash submit-slurm, eval=FALSE}
# Submit the SLURM job
sbatch <project_name>.slurm.sh
```

- Once the job is complete, transfer results back to your local machine.  

Advantage of HPC execution is that you
- have more computational resources
- your local machine will not slow down, which happens when you try performing consensus clustering with large datasets locally
- can run multiple jobs simultaneously, with different parameters like distance metrics, clustering algorithms, etc.
