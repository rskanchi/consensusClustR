consensusClustR

[Consensus clustering](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1023949509487) is a resampling-based method for discovering robust sample clusters (i.e., stable patient subtypes) or molecular signatures across repeated subsampling. 

- This repo is an R-based workflow for performing consensus clustering:
  - locally, for smaller expression matrices, or
  - on an HPC cluster for large (genomic) data.  

- Use the `consensusWorkflow.rmd` file to for instructions on running consensus clustering analyses.
